# Seawater-Chemistry-Analysis
This repo is for analyzing water chemistry from NOAA Mukilteo MOATS, Spec pH, Salinity, TA, and PreSens measurements

For our crab metabolomics paper, I used STrigg\_ConsolidateWaterChem.R and Mega\_2016\_data_only.R to do the water chem analysis. 

I wrote the above scripts based on other R scripts written by others at Muk:

- Alkalinity v Salinity_KD_2018(1).R: Kelsey's
- MOATS\_data\_sampler.R: Mike
- Seacarb convert pH temperature.R: Mike
- Spring 2016 Specs.R: Danielle
- Summer 2016 Specs.R: Danielle
