restrict MOATS data to dates of the experiment
```{r}
start_date <- as.POSIXct("2016/11/21_17:00:00", "%Y/%m/%d_%H:%M:%S", tz = "GMT")
end_date <- as.POSIXct("2016/11/30", "%Y/%m/%d", tz = "GMT")

d <- d[which(d$datetime >= start_date & d$datetime <= end_date),]

```

plot MOATS pH data
```{r MOATS pH data}
#plot MOATS pH data 
ggplot(d,aes(datetime, pH)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~MOATS)
```
blip on MOATS 1 between Nov 24-26; but could be real


plot MOATS temperature data
```{r MOATS temperature data}
#plot temp data for all MOATS
ggplot(d,aes(datetime, OL)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~MOATS)
```
MOATS 12 temp probe wonky, don't include that data


plot MOATS temperature data without MOATS 12 which seemed to have a wonky probe
```{r MOATS temperature data, no MOATS 12}
#plot temp data without 12
ggplot(d[which(d$MOATS != 12),],aes(datetime, OL)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~MOATS)
```
all MOATS are a little spikey, suggesting these spikes are real

plot MOATS DO data
```{r MOATS DO data}
ggplot(d,aes(datetime, DO)) + geom_point() + facet_wrap(~MOATS)
```
MOATS 12 and MOATS 1 DO probes have weird blips between nov 24-26 and nov 25-27, respectively

calculate mean temp
```{r}
mean(d[which(d$MOATS != 12),"OL"])
#[1] 10.29312
sd(d[which(d$MOATS != 12),"OL"])
#[1] 0.165076
meanT <- mean(d[which(d$MOATS != 12),"OL"])
```

Convert spec pH at 25C to pH at 12
```{r}
for (i in 1:nrow(Spec_pH)){
  print(i)
  Sal <- 29.62
  #calculate TA ('alk') using the slope and intercept determined by 'Alkalinity v Salinity_KD_2018.R' script. This script compared Fassbender et al 2016 data to data from Muk (Chase's and our data from the past two years). This way, we were able to figure out what our offset is here at Muk.
  TAcalc <- ((50.946 * Sal)+522.506)/1000000
  pHspec <- Spec_pH$pH_at_25C[i]
  Temp <- meanT
  Spec_pH$carbSpecDIC[i] <- carb(flag = 8, pHspec, TAcalc, Sal,T=25)$DIC
  Spec_pH$carbSpecpH[i] <- carb(flag = 15, TAcalc,as.numeric(Spec_pH$carbSpecDIC[i]), Sal,Temp)$pH
}

class(Spec_pH$carbSpecpH) <- "numeric"
class(Spec_pH$carbSpecDIC) <- "numeric"
Spec_pH$carbSpecDIC <- Spec_pH$carbSpecDIC *1000000
```

plot spec pH over time
```{r spec pH over time}
ggplot(Spec_pH, aes(Date,carbSpecpH)) + geom_point(aes(color = Treatment)) + facet_wrap(~MOATS)
```
the Nov 22 spec pH for MOATS 13 seems very off; probably can exclude that

boxplots of spec pH facetted by treatment; exclude Nov 22 spec pH for MOATS 13
```{r spec pH treatment boxplots }
ggplot(Spec_pH[which(Spec_pH$MOATS !=13 & Spec_pH$Date != as.POSIXct("2016-11-22")),]) + geom_boxplot(aes(Treatment,carbSpecpH, color = Treatment))
```

Calculate mean and sd for Spec pH
```{r}
mean(Spec_pH[which(Spec_pH$MOATS !=13 & Spec_pH$Date != as.POSIXct("2016-11-22") & Spec_pH$Treatment == "Low"),"carbSpecpH"])
sd(Spec_pH[which(Spec_pH$MOATS !=13 & Spec_pH$Date != as.POSIXct("2016-11-22") & Spec_pH$Treatment == "Low"),"carbSpecpH"])


mean(Spec_pH[which(Spec_pH$MOATS !=13 & Spec_pH$Date != as.POSIXct("2016-11-22") & Spec_pH$Treatment == "High"),"carbSpecpH"])
sd(Spec_pH[which(Spec_pH$MOATS !=13 & Spec_pH$Date != as.POSIXct("2016-11-22") & Spec_pH$Treatment == "High"),"carbSpecpH"])
```

read in target treatment info and merge with MOATS data so data can be averaged by treatment
```{r}
treat <- read.csv("~/Documents/GitHub/Seawater-Chemistry-Analysis/2016-17_PteropodExp_WaterChem/PteropodWaterChem/Treatments.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#merge treatment info with MOATS info
dtreat <- merge(d, treat, by = "MOATS", all.x = TRUE)

```

Calculate DO for each treatment
I'm leaving in the blips in MOATS 1 and 12 because I don't know if they are real or not
```{r}
mean(dtreat[grep("HH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])
sd(dtreat[grep("HH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])

mean(dtreat[grep("HL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])
sd(dtreat[grep("HL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])

mean(dtreat[grep("LH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])
sd(dtreat[grep("LH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])

mean(dtreat[grep("LL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])
sd(dtreat[grep("LL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"DO"])
```

plot DO per treatment as boxplots
```{r boxplots of DO per treatment}
ggplot(dtreat) + geom_boxplot(aes(Target_Treatment,DO, color = Target_Treatment)) 
```

Calculate DO for each treatment
seems like there is probe drift on day 22 in MOATS 8 and day 29 in MOATS 10, and possibly day 22 MOATS 4. but it only appears to be a few data points, so I'm not removing them for now. 
```{r}
mean(dtreat[grep("HH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])
sd(dtreat[grep("HH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])

mean(dtreat[grep("HL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])
sd(dtreat[grep("HL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])

mean(dtreat[grep("LH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])
sd(dtreat[grep("LH", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])

mean(dtreat[grep("LL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])
sd(dtreat[grep("LL", dtreat$Treatment_abbv),"pH"])
```

plot pH per treatment as boxplots
```{r boxplots of pH per treatment}
ggplot(dtreat) + geom_boxplot(aes(Target_Treatment,pH, color= Target_Treatment)) 
```


make supplementary table
```{r}
#add column for jar so that Spec pH will stay in a separate row from MOATS data
dtreat$Jar <- "NA"
#make a column for time only
dtreat$time <- as.character(dtreat$datetime)
dtreat$time <- substr(dtreat$time,12,19)
#make a column for date only
dtreat$Date <- as.Date(dtreat$datetime)

#merge MOATS data with Spec data
all_chem <- merge(dtreat,Spec_pH[,-grep("Treatment|Salinity|Data_Type|pH_at_25C", colnames(Spec_pH))], by = c("Date","MOATS", "Jar"), all = TRUE)
#remove uninformative columns
all_chem<- all_chem[,-c(4,7,9,11)]

#reorder columns
all_chem <- all_chem[,c(7,2,3,1,8,4,5,6,9,10)]
#rename columns
colnames(all_chem)[5:10] <- c("Time", "pH_logger", "Temp_logger", "DO_logger","calculated_DIC", "calculated_Spec_pH_at_12C")

#write out chemistry to file
write.csv(all_chem, "~/Documents/GitHub/Seawater-Chemistry-Analysis/2016-17_PteropodExp_WaterChem/PteropodWaterChem/Supplementary_Table_1.csv")
